well, my plan is to implement the methodology proposed by Reyes et al 2018 related to the meal delivery rounting problem (read: mdrplib-master/reyes2018.txt). to prove this implmentation works, I wanted to prove it with real data from La Paz (my city) but the busines that were supposed to share the date did not share it. so, to finish my masterÂ´s thesis I change the plans and now the plan is to veryfy that this mothod is agnostic to the dataset, so I created 3 datasset pipelines implmeentations (synth_loader; uses a synth dataser from lapaz. grubhub_loader; uses the data set used by reyes. and, lade_loader; uses a dataset from a paper that focuses to create the LaDe dataset to prove this kind of algorithms) check the project with this in mind to accomplish this goal.
